- **Why**: More generous free tier, no CORS issues with public endpoints

### Backup: CoinMarketCap API  
- **Free Tier**: ~333 calls/day (10,000 credits/month)

- **Coverage**: 2.4M+ tokens, 790+ exchanges

### Supplementary: Binance Public API

## 💾 Data Caching Strategy

```javascript
// Optimal caching to stay within free limits
const CACHE_CONFIG = {
  prices: 60,        // 1 min - real-time feel
  marketData: 300,   // 5 min - detailed coin info  
  trending: 600,     // 10 min - trending coins
  globalStats: 300,  // 5 min - market cap, volume
  historicalChart: 3600, // 1 hour - price history
};

// Estimated daily calls: ~200-300 (well within 333/day limit)
```

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass cards with blur
- **Neumorphism**: Soft shadows on buttons
- **Gradients**: Vibrant purple-blue-cyan flows
- **Micro-animations**: Everything responds to interaction
- **Typography**: Inter/Outfit for clean modern feel

---

## 🚫 Limitations to Accept

1. **No real trading** - Paper trading only (no exchange integration)
2. **Historical data limited** - Free tier may limit historical range
3. **Update delay** - 1-5 min delay vs real exchanges
4. **Rate limits** - Must cache aggressively
5. **No WebSocket on CoinGecko free** - Polling only
